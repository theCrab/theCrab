Writing software has had many different approaches. Software developer are not at best able to understand all the high language mumbo jumbo of selling the end product. We just need a [Readme](). Thats all.

Until you write the **humble Readme** you have no clue what your app will do. And right behind the humble Readme is the **Beautiful Yuu Aiii**.

You see, users love the Yuu Aiii so much without it they dont know what to do. Until you have Yuu Aiii finished you will have mental blocks and lost in translation functions.

Its that simple. the rest of the 300 pages of specs, thats just for paying the spec writers fees.

#### Conclusion:
Write the **Humble Readme** and design the **Beautiful Yuu Aiii**. Then call me to put it together. This is the language of software developers.
