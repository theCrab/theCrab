SENIOR DEVELOPER
I am an experienced Ruby developer with experience developing web services in Ruby on Rails as a freelancer and want more commercial experience. I have a very quick sense of learning, open to learning, always a fool, hungry and flourish in a challenging environment. I have 3 years Rails development experience mainly small to medium sized projects. Before I found Ruby and the community I was a PHP and Web designer.

I have an obsession with clean documented code, am detail oriented, opinionated about best practices and love to ship and reiterate. I am passionate about the open-source community and opinionated software. With Rails I can prototype quickly, deploy high performance scalable services, employ object oriented web design, in a maintainable way and in a language that I enjoy, Ruby.

I love Rails, it makes work, collaboration, testing, moving forward or rolling back not just possible but easier in controlled environments. I am a firm believer in the Rails Manifesto - Conventional over Configuration and DRY (don’t unnecessarily repeat yourself).
