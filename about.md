### Hi I am Crab, a software developer based in Lincoln, UK

I'm a full stack web developer, with a focus on backend systems. I worked with a variety of companies: from small startups (Codeship, Divisare and Frēstyl), medium sized companies (Litmus) to enterprise organizations, including UN, highways and television corporations.

I'm an indie Open Source developer, author of:

- [Hanami]() ‐ a complete web framework for Ruby
- [Redis::Store]() ‐ HTTP session and cache, I18n and cache stores for Ruby
- [Hanoi]() ‐ in-browser, automated jQuery testing with QUnit
- [Minegems]() ‐ private gem hosting deployable on Heroku
- [assets_packager]() ‐ Rake tasks for web assets deployment
- [vim-greenbar]() ‐ streamlined TDD with Vim
- [go-imagesize]() ‐ a Go library to calculate JPEG, PNG and GIF image size

I've also contributed to: [Spree Commerce](http://web.com), [Rack](http://web.com) and [redis-rb](http://web.com).

### Hire me, I'm available.

I can help remotely as software engineer and consultant. I can also do on site training for Ruby, Hanami and web development.
