I worked with a variety of companies: from small startups ([Meema Ltd](http://mema.co.uk), [Waddington Taxis](http://waddingtingtontaxis.co.uk) and [Lupa Design](http://lupa-design.com)), medium sized companies [Uniform Direct](http://uniform-direct.com), (Enterprise St. Helena) to enterprise organisations, including Government of St. Helena.

Languages:- **Ruby** is my main go to programming language
