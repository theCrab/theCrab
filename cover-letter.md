Dear Sir/Madam
Thank you for your interest in hiring me. Please find my [CV](/about) even though it doesn't list my extensive tea making experience.

Seriously, I would love to help you create a fun yet tasteful software user and application experience for your business. I have almost 7 years experience working with:

- Ruby and Ruby on Rails/Hanami
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Adobe Illustrator
- E-commerce (mainly Magento and Spree Commerce)
- iOS

I can help remotely as software architect or developer. I can also do on site *backend* Ruby, Hanami Web Framework and *frontend* web development.

I look forward to talking with you about how I may be of help. Please get in touch.

Thank you!

Nelson
